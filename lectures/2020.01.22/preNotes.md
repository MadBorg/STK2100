## 2.1.1 Basic Concepts

Simple practical problem:

    Identify a relationship that allows us to predict the consumption of fuel, or equivalently, the distance covered per unit of fuel as a function of certain characteristics of a car. We consider data from 203 models of cars in circulation in 1985 in the US, but produced elsewhere. We have 27 different characteristics for each car, four of which are city distance (km/L), engine size (L), number of cylinders, and curb weight (kg). The data is marked for diesel and gasoline.

Some of the data are numerical:

* Quantitative and continuous: City distance, engine size, and curb weight (kg)
* Quantitative and discrete: number of cylinders

Some are qualitative:

* fuel type: diesel and gasoline

__We will in first phase consider only two explanatory variables:__

* Engine size, fuel type
